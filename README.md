## üå∏ SakuraKVM VNC Server Daemon
This is the daemon process implemention of SakuraKVM VNC Server.  

Here is what the SakuraKVM Project:  

> SakuraKVM is an out-of-the-box & all-in-one keyboard mouse video over ip solution.  
> The KVM over IP, which means keyboard, video and mouse, controlled by a simple network port.  
> Allows you controll your device remotely instead of sitting in front of the device it self.

This is a IoT hardware project, 
we aimed to provide a simple, easy-to-use, and cross-platform solution for KVM over IP.

***This project is still under development, want's to contribute? Feel free to make an pull request!***

## ‚≠ê Build
 1. libvncserver-sakura, which we provided a forked version of libvncserver, you can find it in [here](https://github.com/PaserTech-Hardware/libvncserver-sakura), is required and have to be installed first. Follow the instructions in the README.md of libvncserver-sakura to install it.
 2. libcedarc, the user-space allwinner Cedar video engine library (This is closed source lib from allwinner, but we don't have other choice), is required and have to be installed. You can find it in [here](https://github.com/ssp97/libcedarc). Install it with the following command:
    ```bash
    $ sudo ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabi \
         LDFLAGS="-L/root/libcedarc/library/arm-linux-gnueabi" \
         CC=gcc \
         CCAS=gcc\
         CPP="gcc"\
         CXX=g++\
         CXXCPP="cpp"
    $ sudo make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo cp include/* /usr/include/
    $ sudo cp openmax/include/* /usr/include/
    ```
 3. Build this project with the following command:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/PaserTech-Hardware/SakuraKVM-VNC
    $ make
    ```
 4. All done, you can find the binary file in `bin/` directory.
